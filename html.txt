CSS Notes (cascading style sheet)

->style sheet :a list of css rules
->three types of css :
  -Inline :given inside html tags
  -Internal :given inside style tag in head section
  -External :given externally using css file
->types of css selectors :
  - tag name,div,class etc
  - syntax for css:
    selector{
      declarations(key value pairs)
    }
->Types of elements
  -Inline elements:
    -Dont take up any more space than their ontent needs
    -example : span,img,strong,em,a etc
    -Inline elements cannot have margin top and bottom it only moves left or right
    -padding collapse
  -Block level elements:
    -Take up the whole width of a page regardless of content
    -example p,div,h1,h2,h3,ul,li and more
    -Blok level elements have all margins 
    - margin collapse
  - in both cases there are margin collapse and padding collapse in such cases we use inline-block

-> css styles 
  - color
  - background color
  - font size
  - font family
  - text-align
  - padding (between border and element)
  - margin (between page and border)

-> styles can be applied for paragraphs
  - line-height: 30px;
    letter-spacing: 2px;
    column-count: 3;
    column-gap: 50px;

-> border: 3px solid green; - border for an element
-> list-style-type: square; - style applied for bullet points
-> css class selector is used to group some elements and aplly styles commonly
-> To style a link element use
   a[href="some.google.com"]{}
-> a[href*="some"]{
    background-color:red;
    }
    - This selects the links which contain the specified word "some"
-> a[href$=".com"]{}
  - This selects the anchor tag that ends in .com

Inheritance

- HTML element can inherit the CSS properties (font,text styles,colors not margin & padding) that are applied to their parents
- p{
    border:inherit;
    margin: inherit;
  }   
  This will inherit the properties from its parent class
  we can override the property of the parent only for that particular child it will doesnt affect the parent directly
  When we override the properties of an element multiple times the precedence is given from top to bottom so the last modified property is displayed.

HTML Semantic tags

- <main></main> :For the main content of a webpage,unique to that page
- <section></section> :Defines a certain section of a webpage(blog list,contact info etc)
- <article></article> :Defines a bit of content which makes up an article (blog post)
- <aside></aside> :Defines ome content related to something else (similar blogs)
- <header></header> :For the header of a website -contains the nav,title etc
- <footer></footer> :For the footer of a website

Position and Layout

-> static :HTML elements have default value of static and no specific position is given to this value but it does keep the element in normal document flow of the page
-> relative :we can shift the element aound the page relative to its original position in the page
   {
   position:relative;
   left:20px;
   bottom:20px;
   }
   This means the element is shifted from its original position to left 20px and bottom 20px
-> fixed :That positions a certain element relative to the viewport and now the viewport is just a part of a browser that we see the webpage on
   {
   position:fixed;
   left:0px;
   top:0px;
   }
   This will not change its position even if scroll down the page.
-> absolute :This allows us to position things absolutely relative to its closest parent which has also been given a position property.
   This will change the position absolutely based on the position of its parent.
   {
   position:absolute;
   left:20px;
   bottom:20px;
   }
   This will change the child element from left and bottom based on the given value relative to its parent elements area
-> sticky : Its a mixture of both static and fixed
   Its static to begin with then it becomes fixed when we scroll the page when it reaches to a certain points

Position

-> z-index :it bring things forward or push them back on the page so we want to bring this thing forward right here now.
   By default the z-index of all are 0. To make it forward set z-index:1 
-> margin:0 auto; - it horizontally centralizes the content
->box-sizing: border-box;  in case of giving padding to some content it left off the screen when we reduce the size to avoid this box sizing is used

Pseudo classes

-> Style elements when they are in a particular state
-> hover,focus,first-child of a parent
-> Ex :
  form input:focus{
  border:4px dashed #4b4b4b;
  outline: none;
  }
  form input:valid{
    border: 4px solid rgb(53, 218, 53);
  }

Pseudo elements

-> used to apply dynamic changes
-> example
    article p::first-line{
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 1.2em;
    }
    section.join p::first-letter{
      font-size: 1.5em;
      font-weight: bold;
    }
    section.join p::selection{
      background-color: yellow ;
    }
    p::after{
      content: '...';
    }
